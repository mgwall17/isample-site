  **This solution is, I think, the simplest one that gets the job done.***

  However, because of my limited knowledge with MDX and images, I'm unsure if 
  its what a seasoned Gatsby-with-MDX pro would recommend doing, but it's 
  certainly not hurting anything and it saves us from  GraphQL image queries 
  (which in my opinion are real pains-in-the-butt) unless you truly need all the 
  extra functionality.

  NOTE: Call this file whatever you want and move it wherever you want! Just make sure its 
  imported correctly in your layout.js file and you'll be good to go. 
  
  Add whatever additional style rules you'd like, too!
